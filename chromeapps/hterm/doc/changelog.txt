1.12, 2013-06-24, Fix zoom warning.

* Fix the browser-zoom detection so we show the zoom warning again.

1.11, 2013-06-20, Add 'send-encoding'/'receive-encoding' preferences.

* Splits 'character-encoding' into two preferences so send and receive
  encodings can be set independently.
* Refactor Terminal.keyboard.onKeyDown_ to allow Ctrl+Alt+(printable) key
  combinations.
* Fix regression in Terminal..onPaste_.

1.10, 2013-06-20, Add 'character-encoding' preference.

* Adds a 'character-encoding' preference which can be set to 'utf-8' (default)
  or 'raw'.  When set to 'utf-8' hterm's behavior is unchanged from previous
  versions.  When set to 'raw', hterm will not attempt to decode input or
  encode output.

1.9, 2013-06-19, Fix issues with shift-key and CSI sequences.

* Clear e.shiftKey in hterm_keyboard_keymap.js' sh() function so that
  hterm_keyboard.js doesn't apply its own shift key munging.

1.8, 2013-05-31, overscroll fix

* BUG=chromium:245700: Call preventDefault on mousewheel events that we've
  handled.

1.7, 2013-05-31, Fix onTerminalResize, dec12 pref

* Pass width and height in io.onTerminalResize again, which regressed in the
  previous commit.
* BUG=245120: Add 'enable-dec12' preference, off by default, which allows the
  host to control the cursor blink state via DEC private mode 12.

1.6, 2013-05-24, Track terminal size on the io object.

* This installs a default onTerminalResize handler on the hterm.Terminal.IO
  object that records the most recent terminal size as io.columnCount and
  io.rowCount.  This gives consumers synchronous access to these values without
  having to wire up the event handler themselves.

1.5, 2013-04-18, Pass shift-ctrl-L

* BUG=chromium:233008, PASS shift-ctrl-L (CrOS screen lock combo)

1.4, 2013-04-05, wipeContents fix

* BUG=chromium:226819, Handle clearing screen when not scrolled to bottom

* BUG=chromium:174410, Fix to allow Alt-Backspace to send Meta-Backspace
* BUG=chromium:226752, Don't trap media keys (e.g. Mute) by default.

1.2, 2013-03-19, Fix bell regression.

* Fix bug that made terminal bell only ring once.

1.1, 2013-03-13, Grab bag of fixes.

* Fix base64 encoding of the bell audio.
* Break out of a parseUntilStringTerminator_ if an embedded ESC is
  found (other than the one that may appear as part of a 7-bit ST),
  or if the sequence has been going on for too long (measured by the
  wall clock).
* BUG=chromium:191050, Map Chrome OS top-row keys to function keys.
* BUG=chromum-os:30792, beeps accumulate - leads to non stop beeping
* BUG=chromum-os:35288, scroll-on-output doesn't appear to work
* BUG=chromum-os:39645, Application keypad doesn't work properly

1.0, 2013-03-06, Initial split from Secure Shell codebase.

* Move nassh related files out into ../nassh/.
* Add hterm_resources.concat.
* Add bin/export.sh and related concat/ lists.
