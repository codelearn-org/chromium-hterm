/**
 * This file contains the support required to make connections to Google's
 * HTTP-to-SSH relay.
 *
 * See Also: nassh_stream_google_relay.js, which defines the hterm stream class
 * for this relay mechanism.
 *
 * The relay is only available within Google at the moment.  If you'd like
 * to create one of your own though, you could follow the same conventions
 * and have a client ready to go.
 *
 * The connection looks like this...
 *
 *  +------+   +-------+   +---------------+
 *  | USER |   | PROXY |   | COOKIE_SERVER |
 *  +------+   +-------+   +---------------+
 *
 *                         +-----------+
 *                         | SSH_RELAY |
 *                         +-----------+
 *
 * 1. User specifies that they'd like to make their ssh connection through a
 *    web server.  In this code, that web server is called the 'proxy', since
 *    it happens to be an HTTP proxy.
 *
 * 2. We redirect to the 'http://HOST:8022/cookie?ext=RETURN_TO'.
 *
 *      HOST is the user-specified hostname for the proxy.  Port 8022 on the
 *      proxy is assumed to be the cookie server.
 *
 *      RETURN_TO is the location that the cookie server should redirect to
 *      when the cookie server is satisfied.
 *
 *    This connects us to the 'cookie server', which can initiate a
 *    single-sign-on flow if necessary.  It's also responsible for telling us
 *    which SSH_RELAY server we should talk to for the actual ssh read/write
 *    operations.
 *
 * 3. When the cookie server is done with its business it redirects to
 *    /html/google_relay.html#USER@RELAY_HOST.
 *
 *    The RELAY_HOST is the host that we should use as the socket relay.
 *    This allows the cookie server to choose a relay server from a
 *    pool of hosts.  This is *just* the host name, it's up to clients to
 *    know the uri scheme and port number.
 *
 *    The RELAY_HOST is expected to respond to requests for /proxy, /write,
 *    and /read.
 *
 * 4. We send a request to /proxy, which establishes the ssh session with
 *    a remote host.
 *
 * 5. We establish a hanging GET on /read.  If the read completes with a
 *    HTTP 200 OK then we consider the response entity as web-safe base 64
 *    encoded data.  If the read completes with an HTTP 401 GONE, we assume
 *    the relay has discarded the ssh session.  Any other responses are
 *    ignored.  The /read request is reestablished for anything other than
 *    401.
 *
 * 6. Writes are queued up and sent to /write.
